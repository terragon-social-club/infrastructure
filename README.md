# Terragon Infrastructure

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.terragon.us/buildStatus/icon?job=Terraform)](https://jenkins.terragon.us/job/Terraform/)

# Terraform Codebase

The Terraform Codebase is automated by our Jenkins server. Our entire infrastructure is provisioned by Terraform, and any contributer is free to create a pull request that if approved, will result in more infrastructure being provisioned. Currently, we are using DigitalOcean and AWS to host our resources. However, we will move to provision our infrastructure on a private cloud, run on hardware that we own, running VMWare.

# Saltstack

All compute instances are Salt Minions, and are managed by a single Salt Master instance -- which determines installed packages, configuration, provisioned SSH keys, and more. Salt state can be managed right here from our GitHub repo. 

# Security

We're going to make our infrastructure more secure every day. Currently, we have some interesting features like autogenerated SSH keys, which are unknown to the contributers and even account owners.

# Collaboration

Infrastructure can be provisioned and configured by repo contributers. This repo is integrated with Jenkins, which means resources will be autmatically propagated and state will be applied anytime pull requests are merged. This is a rate project that opens up full devops capabilities to our community.
